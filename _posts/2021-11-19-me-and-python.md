# Hello Once more!

I'm not going to lie, I really enjoy working with python. After spending a week learning and programming in python, I'm sad to see it go. I have really enjoyed the simple yet powerful and quick programs you can write, coupled with amazing support and community online, and the modules! There's thousands and they do so much... so long as you know they exist. 

From what I can tell, python is a great language for data analytics and automation. I haven't really programmed python for either of those, but I want to in the future. I definitely have some automation projects in mind with raspberry pi

Off the top of my head, one of the big pluses python has going for it is simplicity. It has been a breeze to learn and understand, and branching off of basic concepts into more difficult ones takes a small learning curve but pays off quickly. I had fun at the end of the week playing around with new ways of getting data I needed, passing it between various functions, and ending up with a simple game that had replay ability.

As far as some downsides, I'm not sure I have enough experience to answer. After figuring out reasons why my code wasn't working as intended, I made changes and never really had those issues again. I don't think anyone is out there building AAA computer game titles using python, but I like the idea of python being a backend tool for quick data manipulation. 

I heard Pygame come up in passing, through slack from our TA, but honestly I was trying to even get a working prototype for my game that I didn't do any research.

From my short research, Pygame would have probably made my game-making experience so much cleaner and easier to manage. It includes modules designed specifically for audio and visuals, user input (joysticks too), mutlicore processing, and its highly portable. I look forward to learning more myself, and upgrading my console-based game with better input and visuals.
