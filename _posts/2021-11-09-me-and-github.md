# Hello Again!

After spending a day working with git and Github, here are my thoughts:

There are many differences between git and Github, and in no particular order, here are a few. Whereas there may be GUI applications for git, the interaction would be limited and not necessary as the idea of version control plays strongly in the hands of a programmer, who will be writing already. Git also resides client-side, right along side the files created by the programmer, in their local file system (or at least the file system where the code resides). 

So Git is: client-side, version control, and predominately short-keyword text based.

Github on the other hand, as far as I know, primarily functions as a remote-availability repository. As the name "hub" suggests, it is a central location for the gathering of programmers to share and collaborate. If you're looking for specific code, coding ideas, or generally curious what others are working on, Github provides the tools to find what you're looking for.

So Github is: server-side, collaborative repository, with text-based and gui-based interactions among remote clients.

Why use Git in the first place? The easiest answer for me comes from gaming, specifically saving. Many modern games allow you to save your game, any number of times, whenever you want. Want to try something different from your main path? Add a new save and head down that road. If you don't like it, you can always revert back to your original. The same is true for git and coding by allowing you to have "save points" and many versions or branches of your game without losing or jeopardizing your original save. The key here is version control. 

If you were to start the foundations of a new coding adventure, bring it up to a point where you're happy with its basic functions, you can leave that code inside a master "save". From there, branch out... literally. Create a branch and try out some new functions, maybe take the program or website in a new direction. With git, you don't have to spend time segmenting your project into folders or separate projects. Your master will always be there with a history of "saves" or versions ready to be reverted if needed.

Why use Github then? Collaboration is a big one. Allowing others to contribute to your project without the need to specifically share the code you've already written. What's more, Github helps keep track of the changes made, who made the changes, and any notes they left behind. Not into collaborating? Github can be accessed from any device connected to the internet, meaning your code goes with you. Instead of collecting projects in a cloud-based storage, Github's GUI allows quick and easy viewing and sharing of all projects you've posted. It's a portfolio of your work, managed and organized.

Now by combining the two, programmers can write and modify projects without fear of irreversible damage, especially when working on server-side projects. With git and Github, a project manager can oversea all changes made to a project remotely and allow many users to work and modify the project at once. With versions and branches in place, combining the entire project into one master-piece is just a few command lines of code away.
