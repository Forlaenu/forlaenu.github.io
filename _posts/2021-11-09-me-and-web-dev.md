# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

Week 1, day 2 of web development and already I'm excited about all that we're going to learn. At the end of this journey, I see myself finding enjoyment in front of my computer again. I will be confident with an array of skills and programming languages under my belt. I absolutely plan on continuing to learn JS and Python and getting my hands dirty with scripting.

In six months, I see myself working from home. I'll be enjoying a career in a field I've wanted to be apart of since 2006 when I started down the road to a computer science degree.

In one year, I expect to be settled into my new career. I'll be experimenting and creating things for fun to break up the monotony of the daily grind, striking off items on my R-Pi to-do list.

I am excited for this future. Can't really say scared, nervous for sure though. I've only ever worked with my hands... granted they'll be on a keyboard instead of a wrench or drill, I know my strengths are far better suited in an engineering field.

By the end of this journey, I hope to be fluently creating automation scripts, drastically change the way I interact with computers in general, and be confident that any idea I have I can tackle.

My current roadblock is based through WSL, windows subsystem for linux and the headaches of getting VSCode, Git, and Ubuntu working well together. Using VSCode's terminal for WSL is unreliable due to the delay... something about the way it "communicates" with WSL. It feels like I'm typing in realtime on a connection with a ping over 1000ms sometimes. I played WoW with ping that bad once, and it was an awful experience.



Prompt
Now that you've learned a bit about what to expect in the course and have seen some of the jobs in the Web Development Industry, where do you see yourself at the end of your 14-week journey?

What about 6 months from now?

or 1 year from now?

Are you excited? Scared? Eager?

What do you hope to accomplish?

Can you foresee potential roadblocks?

What can be done to prevent or circumvent them?

Is there something that I, as your instructor, can do to help you on the road to success?
