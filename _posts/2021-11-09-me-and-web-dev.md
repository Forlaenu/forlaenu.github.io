# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

Week 1, day 2 of web development and already I'm excited about all that we're going to learn. At the end of this journey, I see myself finding enjoyment in front of my computer again. I will be confident with an array of skills and programming languages under my belt. I absolutely plan on continuing to learn JS and Python and getting my hands dirty with scripting.

In six months, I see myself working from home. I'll be enjoying a career in a field I've wanted to be apart of since 2006 when I started down the road to a computer science degree.

In one year, I expect to be settled into my new career. I'll be experimenting and creating things for fun to break up the monotony of the daily grind, striking off items on my R-Pi to-do list.

I am excited for this future. Can't really say scared, nervous for sure though. I've only ever worked with my hands... granted they'll be on a keyboard instead of a wrench or drill, I know my strengths are far better suited in an engineering field.

By the end of this journey, I hope to be fluently creating automation scripts, drastically change the way I interact with computers in general, and be confident that any idea I have I can tackle.

My current roadblock is based through WSL, windows subsystem for linux and the headaches of getting VSCode, Git, and Ubuntu working well together. Using VSCode's terminal for WSL is unreliable due to the delay... something about the way it "communicates" with WSL. It feels like I'm typing in realtime on a connection with a ping over 1000ms sometimes. I played WoW with ping that bad once and it was an awful experience.

I also currently use two computers, splitting my workload and Zoom functions, which has added the hurdle of accessing websites and copy/paste material posted in Zoom chat. Current work around is through Google Chrome's bookmark sync and document collaboration. Might try one of those programs that allow crosstalk/interaction between multiple computers.

However, working constantly to improve the way I interact with these programs and tools, playing on the strengths and weaknesses of each, should help me overcome their downfalls and keep me productive.

I think one thing that would help me be sucessful, given the first two days, is being exact and persistent on the the upcoming lessons and any resources that will give me a heads up. Perhaps it will change over time, as I clearly missed the reading assignment from the day prior. While I have time at night I know I could be getting a leg-up on tomorrow.
